        <h1 data-type>Carn</h1>
        <h2 data-type>Background</h2>
        <p data-type>Carn's rise to power over the Nocth was bloodyâ€”even more so than usual, which is already known to be steeped in blood, as successors and their men fight for who may take power. After murdering the previous leader in a fight to the death, Carn led his tribe to systematically subjugate all others, becoming the de facto leader of the Nocth.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Abilities</h2>
        <p data-type>Carn is a ruthless leader, controlling men by fear. In battle, he leads from the front, covered in blood and other excrements of his enemies, wielding a melee weapon as his men follow behind. Few know his origins, and only some know anything about Carn beyond the fact that he exists and leads the tribes.</p>
