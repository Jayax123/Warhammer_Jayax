        <h2 data-type>Background</h2>
        <p data-type>The Administratum is quite possibly one of the most important factions on Granvalis Prime, as they assist in coordinating the transportation of harvested produce from the planet's surface. Tavian Lirae leads the Administratum on the planet, having been recently promoted after his father's death. Unlike his father, who resided in Ventoria, Tavian resides in the planetary governor's manor, assisting him in planning the yearly harvest.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Description</h2>
        <p data-type>Tavian is quite young for his current position, and it shows physically. He has not received many augments <br>yet, though he does possess a few that assist him <br>with various Administratum-aligned tasks.</p>
