        <p data-type><b>Age:</b> 67</p>
        <h2 data-type>Background</h2>
        <p data-type>Daran was born on Granvalis. His father was a high ranking soldier in the PDF forces on Granvalis, and Daran inherited his father’s position after joining the PDF. He, however, went further, eventually becoming the commander of all PDF forces on the planet, now working directly for the planetary governor himself.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Description</h2>
        <p data-type>Daran Maron isn’t particularly large, being mostly average in height and build. After he began balding, he chose to shave his head entirely. Unlike his father now that he commands all pdf troops, he usually forgoes military uniforms for himself in favor of various suits.</p>
