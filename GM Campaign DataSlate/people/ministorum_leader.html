        <h2 data-type>Background</h2>
        <p data-type>Mancar is the religious leader of all those on Granvalis Prime's surface, though he seldom holds formal church services. He often provides religious guidance to those who seek him, as the various communities are spread far apart due to their farming of nearly all the planetâ€™s available land. Because of this, Mancar takes a more passive role in his preaching, instead supplying people with religious texts and tools so they may pray on their own, wherever they are, rather than in massive churches. He does, <br>however, maintain a church and a small area on <br>Granvalis Prime, set apart from most of the <br>population. Some make small pilgrimages to this <br>church to hear his guidance in person.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Description</h2>
        <p data-type>Mancar is elderly and often wears garments <br>that cover nearly his entire body. He is <br>frequently seen using a walking cane or <br>similar aid to move about. In addition, <br>he regularly wears gas masks and other <br>protective gear to shield himself from the <br>harmful gases present on Granvalis.</p>
