        <p data-type>Marcus Camperstris is the planetary governor of Granvalis Prime, a massive agriworld. Part of a long family line of planetary governors for Granvalis Prime, Marcus was born into wealth and had to do little throughout his life, mostly just making large decisions for his planet, leaving the minor ones to his attendants. His wife passed in childbirth, and he didn't hold any relationships either, having only one daughter who is set to inherit when Marcus dies.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Description</h2>
        <p data-type>Marcus Camperstris is a rather large man; he rarely leaves his manor, giving him a pale skin complexion. He usually wears fine clothes and is generally stationary, but always maintains proper clothing and manners when around others.</p>
