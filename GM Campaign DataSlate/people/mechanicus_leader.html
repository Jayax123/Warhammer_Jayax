        <h2 data-type>Background</h2>
        <p data-type>Little is known about Vexok (as non-Mechanicus individuals refer to them). They were neither born nor raised on the planet; instead, they were assigned there for unknown reasonsâ€”most likely as punishment for some failure. They remain highly mysterious, but what is known is that they are a high-ranking Enginseer who commands all Mechanicus assets on the planet.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Description</h2>
        <p data-type>Vexok has little humanity left, most of their body having been replaced by robotic parts, with <br>numerous appendages installed to <br>assist in repairs and <br>handling various tasks.</p>
