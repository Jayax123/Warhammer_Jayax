        <h2 data-type>Summary</h2>
        <p data-type>The Lux Veritatis, or "The Church," is one of the few holy locations on Ganvalis Prime. Due to the planet's sparse population, it is difficult for churches and similar institutions to be built. As a result, this is the main center of the Ministorum's power. Most people on the planet's surface hold prayers and religious observances in their homes or residences rather than in large churches. The Sanctum serves as a place where many come to receive religious counselingâ€”typically only a few times throughout their lives.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Location</h2>
        <p data-type>"The Church," so called because it is one of the few actual large places of prayer on the <br>planet, was constructed <br>before most of the <br>current buildings. It <br>now stands in a location <br>almost completely <br>isolated from the rest <br>of Ganvalis Prime, where <br>only the most devout <br>maintain permanent <br>residence.</p>
