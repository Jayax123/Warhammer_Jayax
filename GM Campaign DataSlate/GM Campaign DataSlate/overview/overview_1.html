        <h2 data-type>And So It Begins</h2>
        <p data-type>You have been deployed to Granvalis Prime to investigate the cause of the planetâ€™s declining tithe over the years. Little is known about the current situation on the surface. A smaller team previously dispatched by the Administratum failed to return, prompting the need for a more capable and reinforced group. Your mission is to uncover the truth behind the disruption, assess the conditions on the planet, and determine the best course of action to restore Granvalis Prime to its expected levels of production and tithing.</p>
