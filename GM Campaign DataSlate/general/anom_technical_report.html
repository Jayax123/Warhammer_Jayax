        <h1 data-type>Brief: Problems On Granvalis Prime</h1>
        <h2 data-type>Overview</h2>
        <p data-type>Investigations into the issues affecting Granvalis Prime have yielded multiple and at times contradictory findings. The crime group known as the Nocth is reported to steal agricultural produce, and while many consider them a major threat, some data suggests their impact may be less severe than commonly believed. We are unsure exactly what is causing the all the problems some locals claim the planetary govenor is selling some produce to enemies, but this claims remain unsubstantiated.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Pesticides</h2>
        <p data-type>While limited data indicates a direct impact on agricultural output, the population of Granvalis Prime is suffering significantly due to the planet’s toxic atmosphere, a result of extensive pesticide use. The protective suits worn by inhabitants offer only partial protection, and many are falling ill from prolonged exposure to their own planet’s air.</p>
