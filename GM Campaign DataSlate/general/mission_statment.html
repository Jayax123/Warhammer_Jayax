        <h1 data-type>Mission Statment</h1>
        <p data-type>The planet Granvalis Prime has been progressively failing to meet its tithe requirements by an increasing margin. This is of great importance, as the agri-world produces wheat that sustains numerous hive worlds and warfronts, making it central to the Imperium’s operations in the region. A previous expedition was dispatched but has gone vox-dead after entering the planet, prompting approval for a stronger application of force to resolve the situation.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Objective</h2>
        <p data-type>You, along with a delegation of others, will be deployed to investigate what is preventing the agri-world from operating at full capacity. Once the cause is identified, it is your responsibility to resolve or eliminate the source of the problem by any means you deem necessary, provided that the planet's output is restored to standard levels.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Description</h2>
        <p data-type>Of Plows and Politics will begin with roleplay and is likely to conclude with more combat-focused action. You will first arrive on Granvalis Prime with your force, where a small team led by your OC will investigate the cause behind the planet’s failure to meet its tithe. Any larger forces under your command may be deployed and positioned across the planet as you see fit, or assigned to other tasks in preparation for potential conflict later in the campaign.</p>
