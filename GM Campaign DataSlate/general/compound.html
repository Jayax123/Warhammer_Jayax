        <h2 data-type>Background</h2>
        <p data-type>Cenotyxin 41 was developed years before Granvalis Prime was colonized by humans, but it was mostly kept in storage, having little to no known practical use. Eventually, however, it was introduced as a pesticide on Granvalis Prime to eliminate a native pest that other pesticides had failed to control. Although numerous negative side effects were known, the long-term effects were never thoroughly tested, as the harvest was under threat and extended testing would have caused too much crop failure in the interim.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Description</h2>
        <p data-type>Cenotyxin 41 is purple in color and leaves a thin coating of purple dust on plants, which sticks to insects and kills them when used, while leaving most plants unharmed.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Exposure</h2>
        <p data-type>Short-term exposure to Cenotyxin 41 can cause negative side effects such as temporary loss of vision, respiratory problems, and headaches. However, these symptoms typically subside if there is no further exposure. Many residents of Granvalis Prime have developed a resistance to the short-term effects of the pesticide, but there is no known way to resist its long-term consequences. These long-term side effects include insanity, dementia, permanent loss of vision, chronic vomiting, and permanent purple discoloration of the skin, often appearing in ring-shaped patterns. <b>WARNING: Madness caused by Cenotyxin exposure can often lead to corruption as mental faculties deteriorate.</b></p>
        <h2 data-type>Safety Precations</h2>
        <p data-type>When outside of properly filtrated buildings protected suits should be worn to protect against outside contaimenents. Most suits worn by residents however are not completely secure often leading to some people on planet gaining long term symptoms of Cenotyxin 41 these people are to quickly be brought to site <mark style="background-color: #65b38a;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</mark> <mark style="background-color: #65b38a;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</mark></p>
