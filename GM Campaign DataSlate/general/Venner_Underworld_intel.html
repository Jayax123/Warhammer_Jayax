        <h1 data-type>Brief: Criminal Elements On Granvalis Prime</h1>
        <h2 data-type>Overview</h2>
        <p data-type>Granvalis Prime has only a handful of urban centers, which keeps overall crime relatively low compared with other regions; nevertheless, criminal activity still exists. In the more densely populated districts, local gangs sometimes steal portions of the planet’s agricultural output, but none of these groups exert influence beyond their immediate neighborhoods.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Nocth</h2>
        <p data-type>The Nocth are a different breed compared to the other gangs. They operate from their own strongholds and conduct raids on cities and transport routes across Granvalis Prime. Led by a bloodthirsty and ruthless figure, the Nocth pose a serious threat and must be approached with caution. To learn more, type 'Nocth.' However, much about their leader remains unknown further investigation will be necessary to uncover the full extent of their operations and intentions.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Description</h2>
        <p data-type>Of Plows and Politics will begin with roleplay and is likely to conclude with more combat-focused action. You will first arrive on Granvalis Prime with your force, where a small team led by your OC will investigate the cause behind the planet’s failure to meet its tithe. Any larger forces under your command may be deployed and positioned across the planet as you see fit, or assigned to other tasks in preparation for potential conflict later in the campaign.</p>
