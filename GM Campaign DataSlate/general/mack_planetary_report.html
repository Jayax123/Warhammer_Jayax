        <h1 data-type>Brief: Planetary Governors Profile</h1>
        <h2 data-type>Overview</h2>
        <p data-type>There is little nobility on Granvalis Prime beyond the planetary governor, with the closest equivalents being those who assist in administering major cities like Ventoria. The planetary governor himself appears to have a close relationship with the local Administratum officials and receives frequent visits from the commander of the Planetary Defence Forces.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Hidden Meetings</h2>
        <p data-type>The planetary governor has held a series of private meetings with high-ranking officials, primarily the commander of the PDF and the head of the local Administratum. These meetings typically involve only the governor and the official in question, with trusted aides present only on rare occasions. As a result, the contents of these discussions remain unknown but the secrecy and frequency suggest intentions that are far from benevolent.</p>
