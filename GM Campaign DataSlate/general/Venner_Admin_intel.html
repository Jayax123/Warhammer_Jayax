        <h1 data-type>Brief: Administratum On Granvalis Prime</h1>
        <h2 data-type>Overview</h2>
        <p data-type>The Administratum serves an essential role on Ganvalis Prime as they monitor and assist in the logistics holding some presence in most cities. They hold their largest presence in the planetary govenors manor however where their leader also resides assisting the planetary govenor in whatever he may need.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Quistonable Loyalty</h2>
        <p data-type>Following some investigation, it has been revealed that the current leader of the Administratum, Tavian Lirae, was recently appointed after his predecessor died under mysterious circumstances. While previous leaders were known for their loyalty to the planetary governor, Tavian appears to have taken this even further. This has led some to question whether his allegiance to the governor outweighs his loyalty to the Administratum itself.</p>
