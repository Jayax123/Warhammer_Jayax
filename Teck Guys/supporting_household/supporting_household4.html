            <p><b>House Type: </b>Level x Military Household</p>

            <p><b>House History: </b>House Rian specializes in long-range weaponry, particularly advanced sniping technology—not only the weapons themselves, but also scopes and specialized equipment that snipers and spotters require to operate effectively. House Rian is also known for training some of the finest sharpshooters, capable of embedding themselves in hostile territory and eliminating high-value targets from extreme distances, often without ever being seen until it's far too late.</p>

            <p>House Rian snipers usually operate in <br>pairs: a spotter and a sniper, both <br>augmented and trained very <br>differently. The spotter is <br>responsible for identifying and <br>tracking targets, providing <br>information to guide the sniper’s <br>shots. They also serve as a <br>bodyguard often augmented for <br>mid- to close-range combat and <br>equipped with weaponry suited <br>for such engagements. The <br>sniper, on the other hand, is <br>equipped almost exclusively for <br>long-range shooting. They are <br>typically fragile in close combat,<br> as their focus is entirely on <br>eliminating targets from a <br>distance. House Rian snipers are <br>considered among the best in their <br>field, highly specialized in their <br>roles.</p>
