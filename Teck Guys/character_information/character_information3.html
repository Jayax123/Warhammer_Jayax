            <p>Macille only trusts his closest aide and is usually outwardly friendly, though this is more to maintain appearances than genuine goodwill. Growing up in a noble house has made him value manners highly, especially because his treatment growing up has led him to perceive any breach of proper manners by others as a personal slight. He may even take violent action in response, though this is typically carried out by others on his behalf. Macille rarely handles matters in person, almost always delegating tasks to subordinates. He prefers to have others perform manual labor or carry out his orders in his stead.</p>

            <p><b>Augmentations: </b>House Nomenica, as a dealer of technology and arms, spares no expense in augmentations for anyone in the noble line. Macille is highly augmented, with large portions of his flesh almost entirely replaced by machinery designed to enhance his combat abilities and, more significantly, his mental capabilities beyond what a normal human can achieve.</p>
