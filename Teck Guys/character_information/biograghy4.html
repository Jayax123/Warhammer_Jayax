        <p data-type><b>Talents And Abilities:</b> Macille holds <br>little special talent in combat. Trained <br>to some degree since birth as a noble, <br>he is adequate but lacks any <br>extraordinary skill in the realm of combat. He is reasonably talented in strategy and planning, though not beyond what a typically capable individual might achieve. He is highly augmented, equipped with advanced armor and weapons to gain any advantage that machinery can provide, reducing the effort required to maintain his edge.</p>

        <p data-type><b>Augmentations:</b> House Nomenica, as a dealer of technology and arms, spares no expense in augmentations for anyone in the noble line. Macille is highly augmented, with large portions of his flesh almost entirely replaced by machinery designed to enhance his combat abilities and, more significantly, his mental capabilities beyond what a normal human can achieve.</p>
