        <p data-type><b>Personality:</b> Macille only trusts his <br>closest aide and is usually outwardly <br>friendly, though this is more to maintain <br>appearances than genuine goodwill. Growing <br>up in a noble house has made him value <br>manners highly, especially because his treatment growing up has led him to perceive any breach of proper manners by others as a personal slight. He may even take violent action in response, though this is typically carried out by others on his behalf. Macille rarely handles matters in person, almost always delegating tasks to subordinates. He prefers to have others perform manual labor or carry out his orders in his stead.</p>
        <p data-type><b>Talents And Abilities:</b> Macille holds little special talent in combat. Trained to some degree since birth as a noble, he is adequate but lacks any extraordinary skill in the realm of combat. He is reasonably talented in strategy and planning, though not beyond what a typically capable individual might achieve. He is highly augmented, equipped with advanced armor and weapons to gain any advantage that machinery can provide, reducing the effort required to maintain his edge.</p>
