        <p data-type>   Instead, he began to resent his <br>siblings for having what he always <br>wanted and to hate his father for <br>never giving him the love and <br>attention he so craved. Determined to make his own path, Macille decided that if he couldnâ€™t have their affection, he would instead seek power. He took to the stars to prove himself to his family and, ultimately, to gain enough power to overthrow his father and take over as patriarch, proving his family wrong and claiming control of what they always believed he could never achieve.</p>

        <p data-type><b>Personality:</b> Macille only trusts his closest aide and is usually outwardly friendly, though this is more to maintain appearances than genuine goodwill. Growing up in a noble house has made him value manners highly, especially because his treatment growing up has led him to perceive any breach of proper manners by others as a personal slight. He may even take violent action in response, though this is typically carried out by others on his behalf. Macille rarely handles matters in person, almost always delegating tasks to subordinates. He prefers to have others perform manual labor or carry out his orders in his stead.</p>
