        <h2 data-type>Backstory</h2>
        <p data-type>   Macille was born third in line for <br>House Nomenica, having an older brother <br>and an older sister, both of whom were <br>born to the patriarch of House Domenica and his wife in an arranged marriage with another noble house. Macille, however, was born out of wedlock from an affair his father had with a commoner. After the affair was discovered, and while Macille was still young, his mother was killed, and he was brought into the household, though he was kept far away from the main family in a separate estate.</p>

        <p data-type>   Macille grew up within the estate with a few servants and teachers  there to raise him. Having little to no familial love, he often tried overly hard to achieve great things in the hope that his father would notice and show him affection. That attention, sadly, never came.</p>
        
        <p data-type>As Macille grew older, he became more detached from his need for familial love and from people in general, realizing that the affection he desperately sought the kind his siblings received would never be given to him.</p>
          
        <p data-type>   Instead, he began to resent his siblings for having what he always wanted and to hate his father for never giving him the love and attention he so craved. Determined to make his own path, Macille decided that if he couldnâ€™t have their affection, he would instead seek power. He took to the stars to prove himself to his family and, ultimately, to gain enough power to overthrow his father and take over as patriarch, proving his family wrong and claiming control of what they always believed he could never achieve.</p>
