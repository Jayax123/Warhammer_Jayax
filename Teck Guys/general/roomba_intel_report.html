        <h2 data-type>Initial Team</h2>
        <p data-type>Not expecting much combat, the original team was mostly composed of lower-ranking Administratum officials, with only a small group of Literati assigned as a guard detail. This team was primarily sent to work directly with the planetary governor and local Administratum officials to determine the cause of the unmet tithe.</p>
        <h2 data-type>Disappearance</h2>
        <p data-type>There are contradictory reports regarding what happened to the team that disappeared. The planetary governor claims that illegal groups on the planet were responsible for their deaths, but the immediate radio silence without any distress signals cast doubt on this explanation.</p>
        <p data-type>Another theory suggests that the planetary governor or local Administratum officials were responsible for the team's disappearance. However, the motive behind such an act or what they might be attempting to conceal is currently unknown. Given their access to resources capable of suppressing all outgoing communications, they remain viable suspects.</p>
