            <p style="margin-bottom: 1px;"><b>Enemy of the Mechanicus: </b>This individual secretly is trying to subvert the Mechanicus, through whatever means they have available, to their own benefit or against the wider Mechanicus.</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <li><p>Can rephrase Champions types to be Robots.</p></li>
                <li><p>This individual can purchase a type of Blank called a Discordant, individuals highly capable of manipulating machine spirits around them, such as being able to simply turn off vehicles they come into contact with.</p></li>
                <li><p>You may experiment with technology and commit some amounts of Tech Heresy, such as fucking around with thinking machines and robots. You may replace men with constructs of metal. </p></li>
                <li><p>This individual can purchase Savants which cost 10% each. These are a type of Champion. They provide the benefits of a Level 1 Tech Priest without being bound to the Mechanicus. However, they will often be very quickly gathered up and shot if found out. They can be made to act as Sub-OC and act as Level 2 in a discipline for 5%, and they can be upgraded to Level 3 in a discipline for an additional 10% (Level 3 Champion). They do not gain access to maniples. </p></li>
                <li><p>Your Savant and Tech can and will get you in trouble if flaunted or revealed to the wrong forces, expect to make more enemies than friends. You may not gain standing with the Mechanicus over 0. You may no longer take TP attaches. </p></li>
