        <p data-type>   On a mostly Mechanicus-controlled <br>planet, forces like House Nomenica would <br>either be expelled at best or condemned as <br>techno-heretics at worst. The higher-ups <br>in House Nomenica faced a dire choice: adapt or lose their power and likely their lives. Ultimately, House Nomenica fled to the stars, taking much of their developed technology aboard ships that had recently arrived to trade for the planet's resources. However, many members perished during their escape, some due to a lack of resources after abandoning much of their holdings, and others due to the Mechanicus discovering some of House Nomenica's dealings, which led to executions or servitorship.</p>

        <p data-type>   Despite these losses, House Nomenica successfully fled and reassembled, starting anew with limited resources. However, they retained significant technological knowledge and production capabilities, which proved invaluable. This advantage allowed them to transition from the legal trade of technology on their home planet to the trade of advanced equipment. They began supplying forces unable to obtain technology from the Mechanicus, sourcing materials through a combination of illicit trading and salvaging from battlefields, where they recovered destroyed weapons and equipment.</p>

        <p data-type>House Nomenica has never dealt in xeno weaponry and avoids trading in AI, largely to avoid the attention such dealings would bring. While they sometimes experiment with AI and robotics in-house, they rarely, if ever, trade these technologies outside their household.</p>
