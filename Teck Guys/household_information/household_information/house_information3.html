        <p data-type>   Over time, House Nomenica has slowly <br>grown in power through illegal means, <br>operating primarily on the outskirts of <br>Imperial space areas where the Mechanicus <br>is less likely to find them. They strive to maintain a low profile, content to be perceived as a weak noble house trading in common goods. This low profile is critical, as the discovery of their illegal trade could spell the end of the entire house.</p>

        <p data-type>   House Nomenica operates in smaller branch families that follow the commands of the main family; these members are the only people other than the main family within Nomenica that have power. These branch families are often highly specialized in a branch of technology which they develop, or in a particular aspect of combat which they provide to the main family. Nomenica soldiers are sourced largely from cloning though some are also gotten from the general populace both however are modified, brainwashed, and altered to serve only the house loyally.</p>
