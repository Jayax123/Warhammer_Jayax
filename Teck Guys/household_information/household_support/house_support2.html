            <li data-type><b>History:</b> House Venit specializes in producing reliable troops and skilled commanders. As the second most powerful branch family, and the strongest to support Macille in any capacity they hold significant influence. A more religious house with unique beliefs, House Venit is known for its exceptionally well-trained and fiercely loyal forces. While their soldiers typically receive more modest augmentations compared to others, their discipline and leadership set them apart.</li>
