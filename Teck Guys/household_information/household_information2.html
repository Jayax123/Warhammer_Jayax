            <p>Despite these losses, House Nomenica successfully fled and reassembled, starting anew with limited resources. However, they retained significant technological knowledge and production capabilities, which proved invaluable. This advantage allowed them to transition from the legal trade of technology on their home planet to the trade of advanced equipment. They began supplying forces unable to obtain technology from the Mechanicus, sourcing materials through a combination of illicit trading and salvaging from battlefields, where they recovered destroyed weapons and equipment.</p>

            <p>House Nomenica has never dealt in xeno weaponry and avoids trading in AI, largely to avoid the attention such dealings would bring. While they sometimes experiment with AI and robotics in-house, they rarely, if ever, trade these technologies outside their household.</p>

            <p>Over time, House Nomenica has slowly grown in power through illegal means, operating primarily on the outskirts of Imperial space areas where the Mechanicus is less likely to find them. They strive to maintain a low profile, content to be perceived as a weak noble house trading in common goods. This low profile is critical, as the discovery of their illegal trade could spell the end of the entire house.</p>

            <p>House Nomenica operates in smaller branch families that follow the commands of the main family; these members are the only people other than the main family within Nomenica that have power. These branch families are often highly specialized in a branch of technology which they develop, or in a particular aspect of combat which they provide to the main family. Nomenica after gaining attention from armies that almost caused their collapse multiple times instead often have their branch families source units from, and will also often highly upgrade their members of their family instead of sourcing soldiers from elsewhere. This includes using Various technologies to artificially make more members of the family.</p>
