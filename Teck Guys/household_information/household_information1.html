            <p><b>House Name: </b>House Nomenica</p>
            <p><b>House Type: </b>Noble Household</p>
            <p><b>House Colors: </b>House Nomenica doesnâ€™t adhere to a strict color scheme, as it varies depending on position, but they typically prefer darker colors, rarely painting keeping the metallic tones.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1px;">House History</h2>
            <p>House Nomenica has existed for a long time, originally forming on a mining planet that was lost to the Imperium for centuries. Over time, it evolved into a noble household that developed and controlled much of the trade in technology and weaponry. They thrived in this role for generations, but eventually, the Imperium rediscovered the planet. Upon recognizing the planet's wealth of valuable resources, the Mechanicus resumed mining operations there.</p>

            <p>On a mostly Mechanicus-controlled planet, forces like House Nomenica would either be expelled at best or condemned as techno-heretics at worst. The higher-ups in House Nomenica faced a dire choice: adapt or lose their power and likely their lives. Ultimately, House Nomenica fled to the stars, taking much of their developed technology aboard ships that had recently arrived to trade for the planet's resources. However, many members perished during their escape, some due to a lack of resources after abandoning much of their holdings, and others due to the Mechanicus discovering some of House Nomenica's dealings, which led to executions or servitorship.</p>
